          <p align="center">The content of this web site I will be working on, it is a comprehensive guide
detailing my personal experience and efforts in installing Arch Linux
on a 2014 MacBook Pro. This process can be challenging, especially
due to hardware-specific constraints on older MacBook models.I’ve
aimed to share useful insights, lessons learned, and solutions that
may help others facing similar obstacles.</p><br></br>
<h2 class="western" align="center">The Major Challenge: No Built-in
  Ethernet Port</h2></br>
<p align="center">One of the biggest hurdles for me—and for many
others attempting this installation on a MacBookPro from this era—is
the absence of a built-in LAN (Ethernet) port. Installing Arch Linux
typicallyrequires a stable internet connection, especially during the
installation phase when you need todownload essential packages and
system components.Since this MacBook model only supports Wi-Fi for
networking out of the box, two solutions arecommonly considered:</p>
<p align="center"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="left" style="line-height: 115%; margin-right: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; background: transparent; page-break-before: auto">
	<strong>Using a USB-to-Ethernet Adapter</strong>: The easiest way to
	work around the missing Ethernet port is by using a USB-to-Ethernet
	adapter. This allows you to establish a wired network connection for
	downloading packages during installation. While this seems
	straightforward, not all adapters are plug-and-play on Linux. You
	might need to pre-load drivers or ensure the adapter is recognized
	by the system before starting the installation. 
    </p></br>
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p></li>
	<li><p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Configuring
	the Built-in Wi-Fi</strong>: The more complex, yet viable
	alternative is setting up the Wi-Fi connection directly within the
	Arch Linux installation environment. MacBooks, especially older
	models like the 2014 version, often use proprietary Broadcom
	wireless chips, which can make this process tricky. These chips
	require proprietary drivers (such as <code>broadcom-wl</code> or
	<code>b43-firmware</code>) to function correctly on Linux. 
	</p></li>
</ul>

    </div>
    <!-- <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>    -->
  </li>
		</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Loading
		Wi-Fi drivers</strong>: To get the Wi-Fi working during the Arch
		installation, you may need to pre-download the necessary drivers
		onto a USB drive or another storage device, then install them in
		the live environment. 
		</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>
</p>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="left"><strong>NetworkManager Setup</strong>: Once the
		drivers are installed, using tools like <code>iwctl</code> (part of
		<code>iwd</code>) or <code>NetworkManager</code> in the live
		environment can help establish a Wi-Fi connection. This step
		requires a bit of command-line work to scan for available networks,
		connect, and verify the connection before proceeding with the
		actual installation. 
      </p></br>
		<p align="justify"></p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3 class="western" align="left">Additional Technical Considerations</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Partitioning
	and macOS Coexistence</strong>: If you’re planning to dual-boot
	Arch Linux alongside macOS, you'll need to manage your partitions
	carefully. Tools like <code>gdisk</code> or <code>parted</code> are
	essential for creating separate partitions for Arch without
	disturbing your existing macOS installation. Additionally, ensuring
	the use of the correct bootloader, such as <code>systemd-boot</code>
	or <code>rEFInd</code>, is critical to maintaining a smooth
	dual-boot setup. 
    </p></br>
	<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p></li>
	<li><p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>EFI and UEFI
	Setup</strong>: MacBook Pros, starting from around 2011, exclusively
	use the EFI bootloader instead of the traditional BIOS. This means
	you’ll need to install Arch Linux in UEFI mode. Configuring the
	bootloader correctly is key to booting into Arch once the
	installation is complete. <code>systemd-boot</code> is a solid
	choice for Arch, given its simplicity and UEFI compatibility, and it
	works well with the MacBook’s hardware. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>
<ul>
	<li style="display: block"><p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
	<strong>Dealing with Apple-Specific Hardware</strong>: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Trackpad</strong>:
		The MacBook Pro's multi-touch trackpad may require additional
		drivers or tweaking. Packages like <code>xf86-input-mtrack</code>
		can be installed to improve its functionality and support gestures
		on Arch. 
		</p></li></br>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Display and
		Graphics</strong>: The MacBook’s Retina display might need
		further configuration for optimal resolution and scaling. For
		Intel-based models, the <code>intel</code> or <code>modesetting</code>
		drivers should work, but additional settings in <code>Xorg</code>
		might be required for better performance. 
		</p>
		<p align="left"></p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<br/>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Intel Unicode Support</strong>: For better compatibility with modern systems and software, enabling Intel Unicode in your system can enhance character encoding and display handling, especially useful if working with multilingual environments. This can be set up via the kernel configuration or certain Intel-specific software packages, depending on your usage needs.
		</p>
		<p align="left"></p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<br/>
<ul>
<li><p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Updating the BIOS Firmware for Security</strong>: It’s also highly recommended to update the MacBook’s BIOS firmware to the latest version (often referred to as Darwin firmware for Apple machines). This ensures better hardware compatibility with Linux distributions and protects against known vulnerabilities by providing critical security patches. The firmware update can be done through macOS or by using a supported method for flashing the firmware from the live environment.		</p>

  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <br>
<p>To install Arch Linux on my MacBook Pro 11,1, I explored several methods for enabling the Wi-Fi chip.
<br>
One approach was to use the repository method; however, I encountered issues with mismatched keyrings that didn’t align with the kernel version, preventing the drivers from loading correctly.<br>
The most logical solution for me was to create a custom Arch ISO installer with the necessary drivers pre-loaded. This approach allowed me to include everything needed for a seamless Wi-Fi setup during installation.</p>
