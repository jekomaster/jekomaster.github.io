# MacBook Pro 2014 running macOS Big Sur 

### The challenges with installing VirtualBox generally stem from software security enhancements rather than compatibility with Apple Silicon, as this model uses an Intel processor. Here’s why installation can still be tricky and how to make it smoother:

1. **Kernel Extensions and System Security**: macOS Big Sur requires user approval for kernel extensions, which VirtualBox relies on for virtualization. The installation might fail if the system does not prompt you to allow Oracle’s kernel extensions immediately. To check if this permission is pending, go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**, where you may need to allow the extension manually.

2. **System Integrity Protection (SIP)**: Although your 2014 MacBook Pro doesn’t face the Apple Silicon limitations, System Integrity Protection (SIP) can restrict kernel-level software installations. If SIP is preventing the installation, you may need to disable it temporarily, but this should be done with caution as it can reduce system security.

3. **Reboot Requirements**: After allowing permissions and making changes in **Security & Privacy**, a reboot is often necessary. Missing this step can cause VirtualBox installation to fail without a clear error.

4. **Permissions for Oracle Software**: Sometimes macOS may not automatically prompt you to grant permissions to VirtualBox after installation. If this happens, reinstall VirtualBox and immediately check **System Preferences > Security & Privacy** for any new permissions requests.



#### Step 1: Boot into macOS Recovery
1. Restart your Mac.
2. **Hold down `Command + R`** as it boots to enter macOS Recovery mode.

#### Step 2: Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)
1. In macOS Recovery, go to **Utilities** in the top menu and select **Terminal**.
2. In the Terminal window, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   csrutil disable
   ```
3. You should see a message confirming that SIP is disabled.
4. **Restart your Mac** to apply the change.

#### Step 3: Boot into Safe Mode
1. When your Mac restarts, **hold down the `Shift` key** to enter Safe Mode.
2. To confirm that you’re in Safe Mode, go to **About This Mac > System Report > Software** and check if "Boot Mode" says "Safe."

#### Step 4: Install VirtualBox
1. Download the **VirtualBox 7.0.0 BETA1** installer from the [official VirtualBox website](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.0_BETA1/).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts. If prompted to approve software installation from Oracle, allow it in **System Preferences > Security & Privacy** under the General tab.

#### Step 5: Approve Kernel Extensions (If Prompted)
1. After installing, you may see a notification to approve Oracle’s kernel extension.
2. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy** and click **“Allow”** under the General tab.

#### Step 6: Re-enable System Integrity Protection (SIP) (Optional)
1. Restart your Mac and boot into macOS Recovery by holding `Command + R`.
2. Open **Terminal** from the Utilities menu.
3. Re-enable SIP by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
   ```bash
   csrutil enable
   ```
4. **Restart your Mac** to apply the changes.
